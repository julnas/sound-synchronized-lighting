# sound-synchronized-lighting
An AI-based system for real-time music-driven lighting control. The project captures audio via loopback, extracts features (e.g. beats, spectral energy), and uses either rule-based logic or a lightweight neural model to generate synchronized DMX/Art-Net commands for stage lighting fixtures. Developed as part of the university course Advances in AI.
